# elsaify
A cross-platform (iOS/Android/Web) Educational Application For Amr El Saify (Chemistry Teacher)
This app was built to be a better version for students of the [original app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aplus.elsaify).
It uses the same API through a CORS Proxy hosted on [https://elsaify-proxy.ignitionsoftware.workers.dev/](https://elsaify-proxy.ignitionsoftware.workers.dev/) (Based on Cors-Anywhere).

The web build is hosted here [https://elsaify.netlify.app/](https://elsaify.netlify.app/).

*Update*: API is no longer functional.
